## Graphql Server with SpringBoot

### Background

[Rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is the most popular way to expose data from a server though a Web API. It has even gained more popularity today due to the rise of [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and [Microservices Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).

However **REST**, though it is good and gets the job done has some gaps that **GraphQL** has come to fill in [Rest vs GraphQL critical review](https://blog.goodapi.co/rest-vs-graphql-a-critical-review-5f77392658e7) those gaps.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language that offers an alternative model to developing APIs using a strong type system to provide a detailed description of an API.

### Sample Project

This sample project helps build a powerful **GraphQL** server leveraging on the power of [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [GraphQL Java Tools](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-java-tools).

It is a maven-based project. To be able to use it you have to clone and make the necessary modifications required like database because we are using postgresql.

It is not a full fledged project but it can give anyone a kickstart.
